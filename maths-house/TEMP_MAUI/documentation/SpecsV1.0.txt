CREATE A 
In the SpecsV1.0.txt I want you to write the full specifications for this application.
I want you first to read all the files and analyze the logic and extract your self the logic.
However I have explained the business logic just below.


!!! What I need actually is a set of instructions for the AI to migrate this maui code to an angular application ( mobile friendly ) with the same functionalities.
I need a STEP BY STEP GUIDE for the AI to follow. for an agent like co pilot to follow.)
Once the AI has the instructions it will be able to create the angular application with the same functionalities.

For example: 1. Create a new Angular project using the Angular CLI.
2. Set up routing in the Angular application to navigate between different views.
3. Create components based on the existing Maui pages.
4. Implement services to handle data fetching and business logic.
5. Use Angular Material or Bootstrap for UI components to ensure a mobile-friendly design.


BUSINES LOGIC EXPLAINED: So Let me explain first what the app does:

PART ONE - MAIN PAGE
1. On the MainPage we have an image representing a house with some question marks on each window. 
The house has groundfloor, first,second, third and top floor.
The ground floor has a door entrance. first, second and third have 2 windows ( left and right) 
Top Floor has just one window.
In the begining the user sees the house and flickering hand at the first floor and 2 question mark buttons at first floor.
When the user clicks on the hand it will redirect to GameLevelPage.
It will start the progress of a new level. See GameLevelService and GameProgressService.
On the GameLevelService we will display a question and a keboaoard. clicking/tapping on the keyboard will fill the answer box.
When the user completes the answer and clicks on submit button, we will check if the answer is correct or not.
If the answer is correct we will update the GameProgressService to mark that level as completed.
Then we will go back to MainPage and we will update the house image to show that the first floor left window is now completed ( no question mark, no flickering hand), but we will show a picture of the first animal
mapped to that level. Over the ground floor door. The same will apply for all the levels.
Each level has an animal mapped to it and an operation see the GameLevelService,GameProgressService.

PART TWO - FREE MATH PAGE.
On the FreeMathPage we will have a map of ingredients to invoke as spell to free the wizzard named "Math".
For the user to collect all ingredients it must complete all the problems see FreeMathGameFlowController, IngredientQuestService.
Starting a quest will redirect to FreeMathProblemPage.
After compleeting all the ingredients see the logic on the FreeMathPage, the user wil be congratulated and will be redirected to MainPage where
the top floor willl be completed and you can see the wizzard "Math" on the top floor window.

Tapping on a floor animal or the wizzard will play a video and sound.

There are also typing animations and music. 
There are  also transaltions and multiple language support.

SettingsPage, AboutPage.

SO PLEASE WRITE THE STEP BY STEP GUIDE FOR THE AI TO FOLLOW TO CREATE THE ANGULAR APPLICATION in the SpecsForAI.txt file.
Be shore to include all the details and logic explained above. Step by step as the AI will follow the steps to create the application.
